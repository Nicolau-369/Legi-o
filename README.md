# Legião
  "The Future has taken root in the present!"

The idea of ​​creating the Legion has been around for over 4 years, with the intention of creating an independent organization for artists (in general) who have not had opportunities due to bureaucratic or financial reasons, and who over time (and still do) have been greatly harmed by living in a country where, unfortunately, opportunities are only available by following the bureaucratic rules of the state's outdated system.

  With this came the inspiration to create a group that involves designers, writers, architects, mathematicians, many with self-taught knowledge (with or without a diploma), in a technical, courageous and innovative way.

  Four years have passed, with the accelerated evolution of Technology, the main model still being maintained to guide those who want to get somewhere is the S.T.E.M. method (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), to start from the bottom up (different from government projects), starting with technological projects with programmers, engineers, writers, which will depend on basic, intermediate and advanced levels, to use the resources presented to create a world provided for those who have not had the chance to present their skills that can help possible great talents and long-term efforts for a solid infrastructure within the internet and transport it to real life.

  That is why system development projects (existing or new) will be presented on various issues, involving technology in a broad way, from documentation to systems that require more complex operation, that is why you are invited to be part of this world, that is why the name Legion, a team, group, refuge, if you want to be part of it, you will be welcome.
